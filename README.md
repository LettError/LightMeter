# LightMeter
A tool for RoboFont for calculating gray levels at any point in a glyph.

Drag the tool over parts of a glyph to see the gray levels. Blurring happens through diffraction, independent of focus. This code uses its own convolution kernel. I'd like to add support for non-circular kernels. 
To do: wire up sliders for eye distance, typesize and pupil size.
